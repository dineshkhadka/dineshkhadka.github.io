    <h2>Fast</h2>
        <p class="feature-description">
            Junkiree is built to be fast. Junkiree doen't import a ton of library for its featues. It only uses jQuery as the main library. Nepali Date converter and jQuery Knob are bundled in to provide additional features to the app. More speed increases will be added along the way. All of them will be posted in github.
        </p>


    <h2>simple</h2>
        <p class="feature-description">
            Junkiree is extremly easy to use. Junkiree doesn't provide any fancy bloat, we have focused on providing only the important stuff. The interface is easy for anyone to use. The app provides easy and effortless usage without any obstruction.

            Plus, you are free to fiddle with the code.
        </p>

    <h2>Clean</h2>
        <p class="feature-description">
            Junkiree is free of clutter <!-- Unlike the code-->. The primary goal of junkiree was to try to display loadshedding with a interface that doesn't cause your eye to itch. I've seen a lot of Nepalese apps whose UI have made me cringe (not that I'm implying mine is any better). We will continu to work on this in the future.

    <h2>About Junkiree</h2>
         <p class="features-description">

            Junkiree was made due to lack of any loadshedding apps for the desktop platform or at least any usable ones. While the app has been open sourced in order to share the code and also because I wanted people to suggest improvements to the code and the design.
            The app has been made using modern technologies and methods. Everything is simple and open.
        </p>
<h2>About The Author</h2>
        <p class="features-description">
             I'm no fancy developer. I'm a guy who knows coding, currently at the second year of my Bachelor in Business Studies. I love coding stuff and making things happen. I started out programming with Python and currently getting into javascript and all those front-end stuff.<!-- and currently hoping I can strike an internship with junkiree after two failed interviews (my <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Speech" target="_blank">speechcraft</a> ain't my strongest suit). Wish me luck.
